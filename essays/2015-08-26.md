Hi everyone! My name is Mark, and i'm majoring in Management Information Systems, Marketing, and Finance. I originally entered Shidler as a Finance major but decided to add marketing. This past summer I interned with Hawaii Business Magaizne in the digital marketing department where I was in charge of website management utilizing basic HTML/CSS. This is ultimately what fueled my passion for learning more about information systems and why I decided to major in MIS! By traversing through the MIS major, I hope to gain more insight on different applications and a wider understanding of information technology.

In my free time I love to take photos, go hiking, and surfing! I am also pursuing a certificate in French Language and am hoping to study abroad in Europe either next semester or next fall (whenever we are allowed to travel) :(
