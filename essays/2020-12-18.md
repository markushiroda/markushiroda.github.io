Assignment 2 was a very long and tedious process for me. There was a lot of trial and error when trying to further build my webpage to make it more user friendly. I thought that it was cool that this assignment entailed adding a login and registration page that were required to checkout the products on the webpage.

The assignment has taught me the importance of making sure to comment as I am coding. I did not do this at the beginning of the assignment and in result, I was very confused when I had made a lot of changes. If i had made a lot of comments while I was making changes it probably would have made things a lot more simpler and clear. Making this a habit would heavily benefit me as a programmer because it would allow me to always keep track of what each line of code does so that I can make changes accordingly.

Assignment 2 was slightly different from assignment 1 because it incorporated client and server side processing which was a bit difficult to understand at first. Something that helped me was going back to past labs to look at the problems that I had in a similar way. Another thing that was helpful was asking my friend to look over my code to make sure I didn't make silly mistakes. When I would get frustrated because something wasn't working I would usually try to change things in my code which would further mess it up. Having a fresh pair of eyes is a better solution and is easier on your eyes!

If I were to do this assignment over again I would probably go in to Professor Ports office hours so that I could ask specific questions. I wasted a lot of time trying to do something in the wrong way. I eventually figured it out which is great, but it would have saved a lot of time if i had just went to his office hours and asked. I would also probably have a better understanding of the problem.
